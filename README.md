# Google-Colab-6
Word_gen_LSTM.
This is a simple example of building and training a LSTM network for text generation using TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras in Google Colaboratory Notebook. The steps are as follows.

- Load TensorFlow 2.0, Keras and Python libraries.
- Read Alice in Wonderland as a txt file.
- Preprocess the data.
- Build a simple LSTM model.
- Train the model on prepared data.
- Prepare seed text.
- Use the model for generating text.
